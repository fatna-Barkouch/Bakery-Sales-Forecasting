# Bakery Sales Prediction

Welcome to the Bakery Sales Prediction project! This repository aims to provide accurate predictions for the sales of six types of bread in a bakery located in Kiel. By leveraging the provided data, we have developed three models capable of forecasting sales with impressive accuracy. These models are Encoder-Decoder, CNN-LSTM, and Multi-head CNN-LSTM.

## Project Overview
In this project, we utilize historical sales data from the Kiel store to train and test our models. The process involves meticulous data collection, thorough cleaning, proper formatting, and effective organization. Once the data is prepared, we employ graph analysis to gain insights into the sales patterns, which further enhances our predictions.

## Model Performance
Our efforts have yielded promising results. Below are the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Loss values for each model:

- Encoder-Decoder:
  - MAE: 37.49
  - Loss: 0.0051

- CNN-LSTM:
  - MAE: 33.08
  - Loss: 0.0048

- Multi-head CNN-LSTM:
  - MAE: 38.25
  - Loss: 0.0056
